# About Me

I started my career as software developer, but last four years I'm more envolved in the strategic decisions related to the companies where I worked.
During this time I developed some auxiliary tools to help to take these decisions. Unfortunately these repositories are private, so I just can share some part of the information briefly.

## :flying_saucer:  Aerial Mobility

During my journey at Flapper (biggest private marketplace of private aviation in Latin America) I developed several scripts to analyze data. Most of them related to how charter flights are requested.

We experienced a substantial increase in number of quotations so I developed a project how to use the network effect to improve the quotation accuracy. Unfortunately I didn't have time to integrate this component in our system, but I hope to improve it in future, since this kind of proprietary solution would be strong competitive advantage in the private aviation market.

Currently I'm studying future eVTOL operation and these are the project that I'm currently working on:
- [Hoverfly - Visualization of the eVTOL trajectory](https://github.com/avirzin/hoverfly.git):

## :credit_card:  Fintech solutions in Brazil

During my experience working as Country Head for international acquirer in Brazil, we had a challenge to find a scalable solution to perform KYC


Building the whole structure for settlement was particularly challenging.(1)Card brand started settling funds to acquirer that has to deduct the all taxes and fees and settle daily to (2)local merchants and longer periods for (3)crossborder operation that passes through internation payment facilitator company. (4)The major pain point related to Brazilian currency floating (it was the most devaluated currency in 2020) when performing FX transaction was solved. (5)After successful crossborder remittance the funds are settled on the foreign account of the international merchant.
