# About Me

I started my career as software developer, but last four years I'm more envolved in the strategic decisions related to the companies where I worked.
Unfortunately these repositories are private, so I just can share some part of the information briefly.

## :flying_saucer: Aerial Mobility



## :credit_card: Fintech solutions in Brazil



## :jigsaw: Others
